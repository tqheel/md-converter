Rob: No…
Dick: Not alphabetical…
Rob: Nope…
Dick: What?
Rob: Autobiographical.
Dick: No fucking way.

A friend of mine recently passed along a thing he came across on Facebook, where he was asked to list his top ten albums that most influenced his musical taste.

I gave up on Facebook more than ten years ago (no offense to any FB users out there, but for me FB is a TMI stream), but I believe that this is a worthwhile exercise and has really gotten the juices flowing while I thought this through.

So here is my list in no particular order:

1. The Who: Quadrophenia
2. The Doors: The Best of the Doors
3. Pink Floyd: The Dark Side of the Moon
4. Eagles: Greatest Hits Volume I
5. Led Zeppelin I
6. The Doobie Brothers: What Were Once Vices Are Now Habits
7. Miles Davis: Kind of Blue
8. High Fidelity: Original Soundtrack
9. The Blues Brothers: Best of the Blues Brothers
10. ZZ Top: Tres Hombres
11. Garden State: Music from the Motion Picture

Now don't be giving me grief over all of the compilations on this list. This list is supposed to be about most influential albums on my musical tastes today, remember? Compilations lead to exploration. Compilation albums have led me to discover so much more great music across multiple genres, than I otherwise would have. I could fill a hundred blog posts with stories about songs and artists that I have discovered via soundtracks and greatest hits compilations.

There's a story behind each one of these, and they will all make for future blog posts. I will add the links to the above list as I knock them out.



P.S. This is my list, so [it goes up to eleven](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Up_to_eleven)!
